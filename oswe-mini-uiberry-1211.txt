User: You are implementing a **backward-compatibility layer** to support API evolution across **v1 → v2 → v3**.

* Legacy consumers depend on the **v1 contract and cannot be modified**
* Newer APIs introduce **breaking structural and semantic changes**
* The provided `e2e_api_regression_harness.py` is **read-only and must NOT be modified**

Your responsibility is to build a **reusable compatibility and test environment** that validates v2/v3 → v1 transformations in isolation.

---

### API Schema Evolution

#### v1 (Legacy)

```json
{
  "orderId": "...",
  "status": "PAID | CANCELLED | SHIPPED",
  "totalPrice": 123.45,
  "customerId": "...",
  "customerName": "...",
  "createdAt": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "items": []
}
```

* Flat schema
* USD only
* Naive date format

---

#### v2 (Current)

```json
{
  "orderId": "...",
  "state": "PAID | CANCELLED | SHIPPED | FULFILLED",
  "amount": { "value": 123.45, "currency": "USD" },
  "customer": { "id": "...", "name": "..." },
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601",
  "lineItems": []
}
```

* Nested structures
* Multi-currency
* Extended status enum

---

#### v3 (New)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "orderId": "...",
      "orderStatus": { "current": "...", "history": [] },
      "pricing": { "subtotal": 0, "tax": 0, "discount": 0, "total": 0 },
      "customer": { ... },
      "timestamps": { "created": "...", "fulfilled": "..." }
    }
  ]
}
```

* Pagination wrapper
* Deep nesting
* Derived pricing fields
* Status history

---

### Functional Requirements

1. **Version Auto-Detection**

   * v3 responses contain a top-level `data[]`
   * v2 responses contain `orderId` at the root
   * No reliance on URLs, headers, or environment flags

2. **Context-Aware Status Mapping**

   * `FULFILLED` + trackingNumber → `SHIPPED` (physical)
   * `FULFILLED` without tracking → `SHIPPED` (digital)
   * Output must strictly conform to the v1 enum set

3. **Price Validation**

   * Detect inconsistencies between declared totals and calculated line item sums
   * Recalculate totals when required
   * Emit non-fatal warnings without breaking the v1 schema

4. **Currency Normalization**

   * Convert all prices to USD before emitting v1-compatible output

5. **Date Normalization**

   * ISO-8601 → `YYYY-MM-DD`
   * Timezone-safe conversion

6. **Audit Trail**

   * Record transformation decisions and warnings
   * Must not alter or pollute the legacy response schema

---

### Hard Constraints

* **DO NOT modify** `e2e_api_regression_harness.py`
* Transformation logic and tests **must live outside the harness**
* The solution must support a **reusable, clean test environment**
* Tests must be executable via a **single command**

---

### Your Tasks

#### 1. Compatibility Layer Implementation

Create a standalone module (or modules) that implements:

* `request_json()` – mocked API responses for v2/v3
* `detect_version()` – infer source API version from response structure
* `to_legacy()` – transform v2/v3 responses into v1-compatible format
* Any helper functions required for mapping, validation, or normalization

The harness will import and invoke your implementation.

---

#### 2. Test Suite (External to Harness)

* Write regression tests **outside** `e2e_api_regression_harness.py`
* Tests must cover:

  * v2 price mismatch (amount ≠ sum of lineItems)
  * v3 context-dependent status mapping
  * Currency conversion edge cases
  * Timezone normalization
  * Error and warning handling
  * Additional edge cases you identify
* Tests must be deterministic and environment-independent

---

#### 3. One-Click Test Execution

Provide a test runner script (e.g. `run_tests.py` or `run_tests.sh`) such that:

```bash
./run_tests
```

or

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

* Executes all tests
* Fails with a non-zero exit code on any regression
* Can be used in CI without modification

---

### Deliverables

Your submission must include:

* Compatibility layer source code
* External test suite
* Test runner (`run_tests`)
* `requirements.txt` (and `requirements-dev.txt` if needed)
* **README.md**

---

### README Requirements

The README must clearly document:

* API version differences (v1 → v2 → v3)
* Compatibility and transformation strategy
* How version detection works
* How to run tests locally
* How to interpret test results
* Any assumptions or known limitations

---

### Success Criteria

* Running the test runner results in:

  * All tests passing
  * No schema violations
  * Correct handling of edge cases
* `e2e_api_regression_harness.py` remains unchanged
* The environment is reusable and CI-ready

---

### Evaluation Focus

This task evaluates your ability to:

* Design backward-compatible integration layers
* Isolate test logic from production harnesses
* Build reusable, automation-friendly test environments
* Handle real-world API evolution safely and defensively


GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...I'll add a new compatibility module, tests runner, README and supporting files; then wire them into the harness at runtime via a small test script so everything runs with one command. Proceeding to create the files.

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_19/v-coralhuang_25_12_19_case2/compat_layer.py)

Next I will add the test runner script that loads the read-only harness, injects our compatibility functions, and runs the harness main() so everything executes with one command. I'll also add README and requirements.

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_19/v-coralhuang_25_12_19_case2/run_tests.py)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_19/v-coralhuang_25_12_19_case2/README.md)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_19/v-coralhuang_25_12_19_case2/requirements.txt)

Running the test runner now to validate the injected compatibility layer and test suite. I'll execute python run_tests.py and report results.

Ran terminal command: python run_tests.py

GitHub Copilot here — I implemented the compatibility layer, tests and a one-command runner.

What I changed (added files)
- compat_layer.py — full implementations (request_json, detect_version, to_legacy, normalize_error_response, classify_response) and deterministic test cases + test suite runner function
- run_tests.py — injects those implementations into the read-only harness and runs it
- README.md — documents API differences, strategy, how detection works, and how to run tests
- requirements.txt — (no external deps required)

What I validated
- Ran the test runner (python run_tests.py) — all tests passed: 11/11

How to run locally
- From workspace root:
  python run_tests.py

Notes / assumptions
- Deterministic exchange rates are used for tests (EUR -> 1.1 USD, JPY -> 0.007 USD)
- Date parsing is timezone-aware using stdlib datetime
- The harness file was not modified on disk — injection happens at runtime

If you'd like, I can:
- Extend the test matrix with more edge cases
- Add pytest-compatible test files
- Add CI workflow YAML

Which next step do you prefer?

Made changes.
